For this assignment, I was tasked with building a set of HMM models to predict/recognize different gestures. The data I was given was IMU sensor readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes, which was used to train my models. After training, I was able to classify unknown gestures using my algorithm. The gestures were arm motion gestures with 6 options: Wave, Infinity, Eight, Circle, Beat3, and Beat4 seen below.
