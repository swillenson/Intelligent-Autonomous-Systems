Make sure maze.py and evaluation.py are in the same folder as valueIteration.py. Make sure ValQOptimal.npy is saved in the same folder as QLearning.py. These should all be in the same folder if running from scratch.

Run valueIteration.py to see a print out of the optimal path, this code will also save a .npy of optimal Q values. (Saving optimal Q values is last line in the code, and is currently commented out. Uncomment if running from scratch to have QLearning.py run properly)

Run QLearning.py to see graphs of steps, rewards, and RMSE for different learning rates.
