In this assignment, we focus on mapping and localization of a robot in an indoor environment. The information we are given is data from wheel encoders and range sensors. Using this we integrate the wheel odometry information with a 2D LIDAR sensor, to build a 2D occupancy grid map of the walls and obstacles of our given environment.
