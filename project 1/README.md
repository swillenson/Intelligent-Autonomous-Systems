For this assignment, I was tasked with creating and training a model to detect orange traffic cones in real world images, noting the relative center point and distance to camera for these cones. I was given 25 training images of cones placed at varying distances from the camera, as well as labels for the distance of the cone to the camera for each of these images. After hand labeling the data, I used color segmentation and created a single gaussian model for my cone detector with promising results.
