# Intelligent-Autonomous-Systems

##Project 1

Using color segmentation and a single gaussian model to detect orange traffic cones in images, noting distance from camera.

##Project 2

Using Hidden Markov Models from IMU sensor readings (accelerometer and gyroscope) to predict and recognize gestures.

##Project 3

Using SLAM and Odometry to build a 2D map of walls and obstacles in the path of a 2 wheeled robot. Built using wheel odometry data and a 2D LIDAR sensor.

##Project 4

Using Reinforcement Learning to find optimal paths for Markov Decision Processes, specifically in a maze.
